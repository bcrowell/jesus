Sources on the life of Jesus
============================

The purpose of this document is to construct, for my own study, a life of Jesus with a single narrative
thread, comprised mainly of a backbone of text from contemporary sources such as the gospels and Josephus.
I've added my own notes on points that I was originally unable to understand by reading the gospels,
including some information about the political, social, and historical context. I've attempted to
omit all material that, in my amateur opinion, seems to be a later overlay that would not have
been recognizable to Jesus or his contemporaries.
